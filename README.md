# `aisia.ca`

this is a handmade website, for my friend aisia

<p align="center"><img src="png/screenshot.png" alt="screenshot of the website"></p>

this website came about because aisia's username on letterboxd was `aisia.ca`, and i couldn't stop staring at it.
i'm not sure if it's because it's a palindrome, but to me it's a beatiful url. just look at it!
